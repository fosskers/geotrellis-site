        <h2 class="overview"><span class="brandname-emphasis">GeoTrellis</span> aims to be provide approachable, user-friendly documentation.</h2>
        <p>In addition to the standard library API documentation, there are example and use-case focused docs available which describe the motivations, goals, and common patterns of each submodule within GeoTrellis. These docs are more prosaic and are a good starting place for newcomers.</p>
        <p>If the API docs leave anything out and you can't find what you're looking for in GeoTrellis' markdown-based documentation, check out the source. (No, really! We try to make the code as clear, clean and readable as possible and the <a href="https://gitter.im/geotrellis/geotrellis">Gitter channel</a> is a great place to ask any questions.) Then, consider contributing to the project so that your efforts might help others in the future.</p>
